 * @About class: This class is an example how user can create its own analysis class. For example in this class analyse eents from pPs decay and collect statistic how pairs of gammas scattered.
 * Example output is: g1:g3 n [ FALSE = k % ] <-- this means: detected n events where one gamma scattered once and the other one scattered 3-times [ k percent of this detected hits are from the hits merging ]
