 * - list of hits ( each one track interaction with materials in simulation )
 * - information about particle's initial parameters: energy, momentum, polarization, name, PDG code, parentID
 * - gamma kind ( for example: is from pPs decay or is prompt gamma )
 * - information about compton scatterings: number of them, how many ( and they happened ) multiply sactterings in the same volume
