# ABOUT THIS MACRO
# Description: This macro  describes what and when save from simulation to output file.
# One of methods is using Global and Local Actor. Local Actor can be attached to selected
# volume in simulation system and observe each one track (particle) propagating throw this
# volume. You can choose which data save and when ( e.g. save data only for gammas which
# has scattered in Compton process). Global take under consideration this conditions 
# and save data only for particles which met the conditions. Output file can be read
# by Global Actor Reader or in the another way by ROOT Framework.

# Setting up global actor
# Commands "enable" describe what save, while commands "filter" describe saving conditions.
# Description of all enable commands for Global Actor can be found in repository directory:
# source/digits_hits/src/GateGlobalActorMessenger.cc
#
# For two or more local actors you only have to call global actor by one single local actor

# Enable commands

# Try this: if you comment out some below lines you will receive less data

#============================================================================================
# Saving conditions - filter commands
#
# Try this: if you comment out below lines with "#" you will receive a lot of data for
# different processes and particles. Otherwise you will have only data for gamma which
# dispersed in Compton scattering
#============================================================================================

/gate/actor/JPActor1/global/filterParticleName gamma #save only data for gamma, this command can be called more then once
/gate/actor/JPActor1/global/filterProcessName Compton #save only for process with name "Compton"
