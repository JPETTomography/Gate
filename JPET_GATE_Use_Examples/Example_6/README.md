# Example 6 - NEMA phantom

## Example based on:

https://github.com/JPETTomography/j-pet-gate-tools/tree/master/examples/simulations/main/NEMA_Image_Quality

## About sources activities:

1. To maintain the correct ratio between source activities please use only **/gate/application/setTimeSOMETHING** methods
2. By default activities of this NEMA phantom are 10 times lower - it is to reduce time of simulation.
3. This example needs aproximately 10 minutes to simulates 1 second

## Creating of control histograms
If you want create control histograms for NEMA phantom you can find source code for this here [here](https://github.com/BlurredChoise/DataAnalysisFromSimulations/tree/master/NEMAControlHistograms)
